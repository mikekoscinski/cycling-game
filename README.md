## Easter Eggs

This game was inspired by Flappy Bird (2013) and the "Attack of the Prehistoric Pokémon" episode from the Pokémon anime (S1E46).

The sun's reflection repeatedly appears in the ocean background, despite the biker consistently making forward progress along the ocean's coast. This could only happen if the biker were cycling in a circle at the North or South Pole. (Whether or not there would be green grass there is a separate issue!)
