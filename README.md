# The Pokémon Cycling Game

The Pokémon Cycling Game is a side-scrolling single-player game for adventure, cycling, and Pokémon enthusiasts alike. Players take the role of a biker, who must navigate through an onslaught of prehistoric Pokémon to complete the longest bike ride possible. 


## Description

This game was predominantly written in JavaScript. It makes modest use of HTML and CSS as well. 

The scenes of this game are redrawn frame-by-frame to create the illusion of movement. 





## Authors and acknowledgement

This game was created by Mike Koscinski in June of 2020. It is his first programming project.

Ackowledgements and sincere thanks must be extended to the following sources, without which this game would not be possible:

Audio:
- 

Images:
- Pokémon sprites were graciously obtained from https://pokemondb.net/sprites.
- Background images were obtained from the opening cut scenes of Pokémon Emerald for GameBoy Advance. They were obtained via a Google Images search. Unfortunately, I do not remember the specific site I obtained them from. 
- Character images were obtained from Giphy: https://giphy.com/gifs/pokemon-emerald-LJGpExgmRpUbK. They were modified using several free online image editors. 

Guidance:
- This game was inspired by a JavaScript tutorial created by the Code Explained YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L07i4g-zhDA). This tutorial walks viewers through the creation of a Flappy Bird clone. The core logic of my game (its draw function) was informed by this tutorial.


## Project Status

This game is still in active development.


## Easter Eggs

This game was inspired by Flappy Bird (2013) and the Pokémon anime, S1E46, "Attack of the Prehistoric Pokémon". Creating this game indulged its author's nostalgia. He hopes it will indulge yours, too. 

Astute observers of the game's scenery will note the peculiarity of the background's green grass. The game's scene could only take place at the North or South Pole, due to the reoccuring reflections of the sun that grace the top of the ocean. (To the author's knowledge, green grass is uncommon at Earth's poles.)
